## Source Code

All source codes are available at:

- [Design Sources](vga-driver.srcs/sources_1)
- [Simulation Sources](vga-driver.srcs/sim_1)
- [Constraints](vga-driver.srcs/constrs_1)
- [Independent IP Package](vga-driver.srcs/xgui)

## Versions

[Branch master](https://github.com/zan-pu/vga-driver/tree/master) is available as a module for ZanPU. It takes input similar to the data memory module in ZanPU, where the instruction `SW` and `LW` is used to manipulate data.

[Branch standalone](https://github.com/zan-pu/vga-driver/tree/standalone) is built as a standalone version of the VGA driver. It's able to operate by itself and outputs a still image.
